# Color compare

Compare colors to one another. Especially useful for validating color input fields.

The goal of this package is to allow colors to be dynamically evaluated.

This uses implementations compliant with the CSS3 composition and (normal) blending specification. 
As well as the WCAG2.1 conformation of determining color contrast.
